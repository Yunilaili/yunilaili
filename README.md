  ``` hi im yuni (juno and nova are also fine if not prefered) and you probably came here from ponytown. you are always free to interact and c+h (unless you are part of my dni) ,although i may be a bit rude at first but i swear im nice once i get to know you better. i am a MINOR so please beware of that aswell. my interests are mainly the void cult and chonny jash ,but you can find more about that in my strawpage. i feel like im legally required to say that none of my cosplays are forsaken (as i am not in the fandom anymore) ,but i am willing to discuss the topic. ```

  *<div align="center"> dni if*
  
``` you are below the age of 13 ,you are a "freaky" person ,you are prone to being sensitive/taking some jokes,words,etc. too seriously at times ,you just want someone to vent to (this does not apply if we are close friends but please understand that i am not good at comforting people) ,you dont like idling for long times on ponytown (this is not necessarily a full on DNI but i am not usually one to move from my usual spot) ,you apply to any basic DNI criterias ```

   *<div align="center"> thank you for coming by*
